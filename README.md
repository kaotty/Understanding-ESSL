## Abstract
Contrastive learning has been a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning, but it is widely observed that it comes at the price of sacrificing useful features (e.g., colors) by being invariant to data augmentations. Given this limitation, there has been a surge of interest in equivariant self-supervised learning (E-SSL) that learns features to be augmentation-aware. However, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of rigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish an information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability of E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL that creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This synergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve its equivariant prediction, which, in turn, benefits downstream tasks requiring semantic features. Based on this perspective, we theoretically analyze the influence of data transformations and reveal several principles for practical designs of E-SSL. Our theory not only aligns well with existing E-SSL methods but also sheds light on new directions by exploring the benefits of model equivariance. We believe that a theoretically grounded understanding on the role of equivariance would inspire more principled and advanced designs in this field.

## Instructions
All experiments are conducted with a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. We mainly conduct the following experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. In order to prepare for the experiments, you can run the following command.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, be sure to set `data_dir` in `ESSL/config.yml` to the directory where the dataset is stored.

We have three parts of experiments in this paper. The first one is to compare the performance of different equivariant tasks. The second one is to verify that class information does affect equivariant pretraining tasks. The third one is to study the effect of model equivariance. The ESSL folder contains code for the first two parts, while the third part is implemented by the code in the Equivariant Network folder.

### Different Equivariant Pretraining Tasks
In this experiment, we conduct equivariant pretraining tasks based on seven different types of transformations. In order to maintain fairness and avoid cross-interactions, we only apply random crops to the raw images before we move on to these tasks.

In order to conduct the experiments, you can enter the ESSL folder and run the following command.
```bash
python equivariant_tasks.py method=four_fold_rotation
```
You may select the method from `{horizontal_flips, vertical_flips, four_fold_rotation, color_inversions, grayscale, jigsaws, four_fold_blurs}`.
You may also set method to `none` to run the baseline.

### How Class Information Affects Equivariant Pretraining Tasks
In this experiment, our goal is to figure out how class information affects rotation prediction. We apply random crops with size 32 and horizontal flips with probability 0.5 to the raw images.

In order to conduct the experiments, you can enter the ESSL folder and run the following commands respectively.
```bash
python verification.py method=normal
python verification.py method=add
python verification.py method=eliminate
```

**Be sure to go to `models.py` and remove `.detach()` in `logits = self.linear(feature.detach())` when you run the code.**

### The Study of Model Equivariance
In order to compare the performance of Resnet and EqResnet, we use rotation prediction as our pretraining task and obtain the linear probing results. We apply various augmentations to the raw images, such as no augmentation, a combination of random crops with size 32 and horizontal flips, and SimCLR augmentations with an output of 32x32. To be more specific, a SimCLR augmentation refers to a sequence of transformations, including a random resized crop with size 32, horizontal flip with probability 0.5, color jitter with probability 0.8, and finally grayscale with probability 0.2.

In order to conduct the experiments, you can enter the Equivariant Network folder and run the following command.
```bash
python train.py --model resnet18 --dataset cifar10 --train_aug sup --head mlp
```
You may select the dataset from `{cifar10, cifar100}`, the training augmentation from `{none, sup, simclr}`, and the projection head from `{mlp, linear}`.
